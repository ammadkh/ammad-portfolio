Ammad is a talented developer, who does his tasks diligently and in a timely fashion. His knowledge and experience helped with building optimised and clean code solutions for complex business flows. What I personally found astonishing is the speed with which he was able to get into the already existing code, understand it, and start contributing. On a social note, he is a pleasure to work with, communicates well, is easy to get along with, and is an overall nice guy. I enjoyed working with him on this project and would absolutely work with him again in the future.",
